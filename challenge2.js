// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

// 1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

// "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

// 2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

// Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

// Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

// ðŸ‘‹ OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

// IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).

// const massMark = 92;
// const heightMark = 1.95;
// const massJohn = 75;
// const heightJohn = 1.69;

// const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
// const BMIJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

// if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
//   console.log(`Marks's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})`);
// } else {
//   console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Marks's (${BMIMark})`);
// }

// Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs!

// This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

// Your tasks:

// For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith). Name these objects as mark and john, and their properties exactly as fullName, mass and height.

// Create a calcBMI method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Assign the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.

// Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!".

// TEST DATA: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).
