// CHALLENGE #3
// There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print to the console:

// "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

// "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

// "Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.

// TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.

// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.

// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).

// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

// Your tasks:

// Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3 scores. This function should have three parameters and return a single number (the average score).

// Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, and assign the value returned from the calcAverage function to them (you will need to call this function, and pass scores as arguments).

// Create a function checkWinner that takes the average score of each team as parameters (avgDolphins and avgKoalas), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: Koalas win (30 vs. 13) (use avgDolphins and avgKoalas instead of hard-coded values).

// Use the checkWinner function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.

// Ignore draws this time. Instead, log No team wins... to the console if there is no winner.

// TEST DATA 1: Dolphins scored 44, 23, and 71. Koalas scored 65, 54, and 49.

// TEST DATA 2: Dolphins scored 85, 54, and 41. Koalas scored 23, 34, and 27.

// arrrow function to calculate average score sof two teams
calcAverage = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3;

//function to checj winner
checkWinner = function (avgScoreD, avgScoreK) {
  if (avgScoreD > 2 * avgScoreK) {
    console.log(`Dolphins wins the trophy.....`);
  } else if (avgScoreK > 2 * avgScoreD) {
    console.log(`Koalas wins the trophy.....`);
  } else {
    console.log(`No team wins!.....`);
  }
};

const scoreDolphins = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);

checkWinner(scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);
